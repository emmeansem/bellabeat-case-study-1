I recently completed the **Google Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera**, a comprehensive eight-course program I’ve been working on for the last six months. This case study was part of the final capstone project and demonstrates the end-to-end process of preparing, analyzing, and presenting data to support business decisions.

This is a portfolio-ready case study for Bellabeat, a wellness technology company. It follows the six-step data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.


## 📌 Objective

Explore trends in fitness tracker data and generate actionable insights for Bellabeat’s marketing team by applying the full data analysis process.


## 🏢 About the Company

Bellabeat designs smart wellness products for women, including:
- The Bellabeat app
- Leaf wellness tracker
- Time smart watch
- Spring water bottle
- Subscription-based wellness guidance


## 🔧 Tools Used

- **R** (`tidyverse`, `ggplot2`)
- **Spreadsheets**
- **GitHub**

## 📊 Key Findings

- Most users average ~7,500 steps/day; only 20% meet the 10,000-step goal  
- Lower activity on weekends  
- Sleep averages below recommended 7–8 hours

## ✅ Recommendations

1. Highlight sleep and activity tracking in app campaigns
